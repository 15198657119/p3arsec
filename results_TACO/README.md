# Results

This folder contains the speedup results for the different benchmarks and architectures used in the paper

**Bringing Parallel Patterns out of the Corner: the P<sup>3</sup>ARSEC Benchmark Suite**</br>
Daniele De Sensi, Tiziano De Matteis, Massimo Torquati, Gabriele Mencagli, Marco Danelutto</br>
*ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)* **[To Appear]**</br>

Results have been collected by using [![Release v1.0](http://github-release-version.herokuapp.com/github/paragroup/p3arsec/release.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/paragroup/p3arsec/releases/tag/v1.0).

Each of the subfolder contains the results for each of the used platform (i.e. Intel Xeon Server, Intel Xeon Phi and IBM Power 8). The plots show the speedup for different concurrency level computed as the ratio between the sequential time over the parallel time.

Each plot represent a single benchmark. For alternative versions (i.e. for Dedup and Ferret applications) different plots are included.
